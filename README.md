# Orrery Website

This project is an interactive web-based orrery (a mechanical model of the solar system) that visualizes planetary orbits, celestial bodies, and related astronomical data. It is designed for educational and entertainment purposes, providing users with a visually engaging way to explore the solar system.

## Features
- Interactive 3D orrery visualization
- Realistic planetary textures and orbits
- Time controls for fast-forward, rewind, and real-time simulation
- Informational overlays and data panels
- Chatbot for astronomy-related questions
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Video and audio introduction

## Project Structure
- `index.html`, `orrery.html`, `home.html`, etc.: Main HTML files for different sections
- `main.js`, `orbits.js`, `script.js`, etc.: JavaScript files for logic and interactivity
- `style.css`: Main stylesheet for the website
- `assets/`: Images, icons, textures, and 3D models
- `data/`: JSON files with planetary and astronomical data
- `api/`: Backend scripts (e.g., chatbot)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tonypowl/OrreryWebsite-main-main.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` or `orrery.html` in your web browser.
3. For full functionality (e.g., chatbot), deploy the `api/` folder to a Node.js-compatible server.

## Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No installation required for basic usage
- Node.js (for backend chatbot API)

## Credits
- Planetary textures: NASA/JPL
- 3D models and icons: Custom and open-source assets
